Mandelbrot Set Explorer - README

Welcome! This program lets you explore the fascinating world of the Mandelbrot Set.

What is the Mandelbrot Set?
---------------------------
The Mandelbrot Set is a famous fractal — a never-ending, infinitely detailed shape that emerges from a simple mathematical rule.
When you zoom in on the images, you are exploring smaller and smaller regions of this set, revealing patterns that never repeat exactly.
Even though it looks complicated, it’s all generated by repeating a simple calculation over and over.

Program Overview
----------------
This application has three main components: the Explorer, the Studio, and the Colouring system.

1. Explorer
-----------
The Explorer is designed for quick, interactive exploration of the Mandelbrot Set.
It uses a method called "successive refinement" to make the interface responsive, so you can see updates on the screen almost immediately.
To zoom in, simply select a rectangle with the mouse — rendering of that area will start right away.

**Send Coordinates to Studio:**
The Explorer includes a button labeled "Send coordinates to Studio." Clicking this button loads the current zoom coordinates into the Studio render controls and opens the Studio interface.
- Note: This does **not** start rendering automatically. To generate the image, click "Render image" in the Studio.

2. Studio
---------
The Studio is meant for creating high-resolution Mandelbrot zoom images.
Here you can choose the image width, height, the complex center point, the zoom level, and a parameter called maxN.
MaxN controls how many iterations the program calculates for each point:
- Low maxN is faster and fine for broad views.
- Higher maxN (often into the thousands) is needed for deeper zooms to capture more detail.
In short, increasing maxN allows you to see finer details when zooming deeply into the Mandelbrot Set.

The Studio also includes saving and loading functionality via three buttons:
- Save project – saves the current image data to a file so it can be reloaded later and editing can be continued.
- Load project – loads a previously saved image data file back into the program, restoring your session.
- Export image – saves the currently displayed image as a PNG file to a location on your computer.

**Mouse Input in Studio:**
When dragging on the Studio image panel, a rectangle appears just like in the Explorer.
- This rectangle does **not** start rendering automatically.
- Instead, it updates the zoom coordinates in the Studio render controls, allowing you to tweak the center and zoom level before clicking "Render image."

3. Colouring
------------
Both the Explorer and the Studio have their own separate colour controls.
The way the image is coloured depends on several options:

- Colour function: Determines how the iteration values are converted to colours. Each function is named, and you can try them out to see different effects.
- Colour gradient: Preset sequences of colours that the colour function uses.
- Colour flux: Controls how quickly the gradient is traversed across the image.
- Show filament (on/off): Turns the filament effect on or off.
- Filament size: Adjusts the size of the filaments if they are enabled.

By adjusting these settings, you can create images that are visually striking and reveal different aspects of the Mandelbrot Set.

Enjoy exploring and creating beautiful fractal images!
